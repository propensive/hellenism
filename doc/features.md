- navigate the classpath like a filesystem in [Galilei](https://github.com/propensive/galilei)
- read classpath resources like files with [Turbulence](https://github.com/propensive/turbulence) typeclasses
- access the underlying classpath from a classloader
- use polykinded types to get `ClassRef`s, for slightly more concise code
