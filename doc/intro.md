Classpaths are fundamental to the the operation of the JVM, as the means by
which code and data is made available to the JVM. A classpath is specified
linearly as a sequence of directories or archives, which are aggregated into a
unified hierarchy. Working with these two forms can be tricky, and _Hellenism_
improves on the typesafety and syntax for accessing, manipulating and
constructing classpaths.
